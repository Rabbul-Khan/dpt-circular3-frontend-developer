## Time Spent

I started by planning and resarching the project which took around 1 hour of time. I then setup the development environment on VS Code with Vite and Tailwind CSS. Next I implemented the basic UI structure followed by building all the individual components and stylilng them. This part took the longest time of 4 hours. Finally I added some responsiveness and overall UI improvements. In total the project took me around 6 hours to complete.

## Best Practices Implemented:

    * Made use of ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent formatting throughout the codebase.
    * Variables and functions have been appropriately named ensuring code readability.
    * Each part of the page has been broken down into smaller components for ease of maintainability.
    * Implemented smooth UI and responsiveness across several screen sizes.
    * Used meaningful variable and function names for improved readability.
    * Added error handling if data from the database is not retrieved.

## Two Live Frontend projects that I have built and :

- ### Portfolio Website [GitHub link](https://github.com/Rabbul-Khan/personal-portfolio) | [Live link](https://rabbul-khan.github.io/personal-portfolio/)

  My personal portfolio website that provides all my details and links to all my projects. It has been built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Additionally I have used Framer Motion to include beautiful animations throughout the entire website. The website is fully responsive for all screen sizes.

- ### Quotables [GitHub link](https://github.com/Rabbul-Khan/Quotables) | [Live link](https://quotables.onrender.com)

  A full stack application that allows users to share their favourite quotes with everyone. The technologies used include the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), Vite, Jest for testing, Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling. Additionally I have also implemented popular React libraries such as React Hook Form and React Icons. The website is fully responsive for devices of all screen sizes. The features include sign up and sign in for users, ability to post and delete a quote and the security features have been implemented with form validation and JWT authentication. While visiting the live link, kindly please be patient as it does take a while to load. The reason for this delay is that it is hosted on the free tier of the Render service which shuts down connection to the server after a certain period of inactivity.
